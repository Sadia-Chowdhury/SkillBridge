## üîß Setup Instructions

**1. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SkillBridge.git
cd SkillBridge
```

**2. Update the Connection String**

Open the `appsettings.json` file and update the SQL Server connection string as follows:

```
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=SkillBridgeDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with your actual SQL Server instance name, for example: `localhost\\SQLEXPRESS`.

**3. Apply Migrations**

Run this command to create the database and tables:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create all necessary tables like JobPosts, Applications, AspNetUsers, IdentityRoles, etc.

**4. Run the Application**

Start the project with the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
https://localhost:PORT
```

Replace `PORT` with the actual port shown in the terminal when the app runs.
